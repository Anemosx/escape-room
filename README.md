# Escape Room

Multi agent systems have always successfully provided a platform
to solve problems. Using reinforcement learning, agents can learn to
understand their environment and thus deal with complex problems
through optimisation. However, there is one major challenge: agents
always try to maximize their own reward, which means that they
do not take other entities into consideration and as a result act
selfish. This raises the question of how to overcome this problem
and enable cooperation between agents. One approach to create
cooperation is action trading, which allows agents to trade with
each other. This concept has already been demonstrated in a few
domains, namely the Iterated Matrix Game and the Coin Game. In
this work we will try to expand the approach to new environments
and to take a more in-depth analysis of the trading amount. As a
result, we should gain more insight into the cooperative behavior
of agents and possibly improve the trading mechanism.
